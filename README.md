**Initial Code (main.py)**
```python
import requests
import json

def fetch_osint_data():
    sources = [
        "https://otx.alienvault.com/api/v1/indicators/export",
        "https://api.shodan.io/shodan/host/search?key=YOUR_API_KEY"
    ]
    
    data = {}
    for source in sources:
        try:
            response = requests.get(source)
            if response.status_code == 200:
                data[source] = response.json()
            else:
                print(f"Failed to fetch data from {source}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error fetching data: {e}")
    return data

def save_data(data):
    with open("data_sources/threat_data.json", "w") as f:
        json.dump(data, f, indent=4)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    threat_data = fetch_osint_data()
    save_data(threat_data)
    print("Threat intelligence data collected and saved.")
```

**Updated Next Steps:**
- Run the `create_repos.sh` script to automate repository creation.
- Populate README files with detailed descriptions and setup instructions.
- Develop base code for each project to kickstart implementation.
- Add GitHub Actions for CI/CD workflows.
- Add Docker support for containerization.
- Implement Kubernetes orchestration for deployment automation.
- **Include Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform and Helm charts for Kubernetes.**
- **Implement cloud infrastructure automation with AWS, Azure, and GCP.**
- **Include configurations for networking, security, and monitoring in cloud deployments.**
- **Add integrations for logging, alerting, and IAM role management.**
- **Optimize cloud deployments for cost efficiency, autoscaling, and multi-cloud setups.**
- **Develop automated OSINT data collection and storage for threat intelligence.**
